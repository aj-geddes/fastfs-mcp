# Example Claude Interactions with Prompts

This document shows examples of how Claude can effectively use the interactive prompt capabilities when helping users with various tasks.

## Example 1: Creating a Configuration File

**User**: Can you help me create a config file for my project?

**Claude**:
```
I'd be happy to help you create a configuration file for your project. Let me ask you a few questions to get started.

[Call prompt("custom", message="What type of project are you working on? (e.g., Node.js, Python, React, etc.)")]

Thanks for letting me know. Now I'll ask about some specific configuration options.

[Call prompt("custom", message="What environment variables do you need in your configuration? Please list them one per line with optional default values (e.g., PORT=3000).")]

Great! One last question before I create the file.

[Call prompt("custom", message="Where would you like to save this configuration file? (e.g., .env, config.json, etc.)")]

Thanks for providing all that information. I'll create your configuration file now.

[Call interactive_write(file_path)]

I've successfully created your configuration file with the settings you specified. Is there anything else you'd like to add or modify?
```

## Example 2: Finding and Editing a Specific File

**User**: I need to update one of my JavaScript files but I'm not sure which one contains the function I need to change.

**Claude**:
```
I can help you find and update the JavaScript file. Let's start by identifying which file contains the function you want to modify.

[Call prompt("custom", message="What is the name of the function you're looking to change?")]

Thanks! Let me search for JavaScript files that contain this function.

[Call find(".", "*.js", file_type="f")]

I found several JavaScript files. Let me check each one for your function.

[For each file, call grep(function_name, file_path)]

I found the function in these files:
[List files that contain the function]

Let's select which file you want to edit:

[Call select_file(".", pattern_based_on_search_results)]

Great! Here's the current content of the file:

[Call read(selected_file)]

Now, let me ask what changes you want to make:

[Call get_file_content(selected_file)]

Before I save these changes, let me confirm:

[Call confirm_overwrite(selected_file)]

I've updated the file with your changes. The function has been modified as requested.
```

## Example 3: Project Initialization

**User**: Can you help me start a new web application project?

**Claude**:
```
I'd be happy to help you set up a new web application project. Let's gather some information about what you want to create.

[Call init_project()]

Great! I've created a new project directory with the basic structure. Here's what I've set up:

- Created a directory structure for your web application
- Added a README.md file with project information
- Set up basic configuration files

Would you like me to help you create any specific components or files for your web application?

[Call prompt("custom", message="What feature would you like to implement first in your web application?")]

Let's create that feature. I'll help you set up the necessary files:

[Create relevant files based on user response]

Your initial project setup is complete! Here's a summary of what we've created:
[List files and directories created]

Would you like me to explain how to run or further develop this project?
```

## Example 4: Guided File Management

**User**: I have a bunch of log files that I need to organize.

**Claude**:
```
I can help you organize your log files. Let's start by identifying them and determining how you'd like them organized.

[Call find(".", "*.log", file_type="f")]

I found the following log files:
[List log files found]

[Call prompt("custom", message="How would you like to organize these log files? Options:\n1. By date\n2. By type/category\n3. Combine into a single archive\n4. Something else (please specify)")]

Based on your choice, let's proceed with organizing the files:

[For option 1: Parse dates from filenames and organize accordingly]
[For option 2: Prompt for categories and organize]
[For option 3: Create a compressed archive]
[For option 4: Custom solution based on response]

[Call prompt("custom", message="Would you like me to create a backup of these files before reorganizing them? (yes/no)")]

[If yes, create backup]

Now I'll organize your files as requested:
[Perform organization operations]

The organization is complete! Here's the new structure:
[Show new organization]

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with regarding these files?
```

## Best Practices Demonstrated

These examples demonstrate several best practices:

1. **Clear communication**: Claude explains what it's doing at each step
2. **Progressive disclosure**: Complex tasks are broken down into manageable steps
3. **Confirmation for important actions**: Changes are confirmed before being applied
4. **Contextual prompts**: Questions are based on previous responses
5. **Helpful summaries**: Results are summarized after completion
6. **Offering additional help**: Claude offers to assist with related tasks

By following these patterns, Claude can provide a helpful and intuitive experience when using interactive prompts to assist users with filesystem tasks.
