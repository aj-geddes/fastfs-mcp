# FastFS-MCP - Fixed Version

This repository contains a fixed version of FastFS-MCP, a high-speed MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for filesystem operations, Git integration, and interactive prompting capabilities, designed to work seamlessly with Claude and AI-native tooling.

## 🛠️ Fixed Issues

1. **Fixed `base.py` indentation error** - Corrected the indentation issue in the `git/base.py` file that was causing import errors and package structure test failures.

2. **Created unified build script** - Created `rebuild_fastfs.sh` as a unified build script that handles building, testing, and running the FastFS-MCP server, replacing the previous `build_fastfs_mcp.sh` script.

3. **Added comprehensive documentation** - Created architecture documentation with Mermaid diagrams that visualize the project structure, component interactions, authentication flow, error handling, and module dependencies.

4. **Improved module documentation** - Added professional comment blocks to all modules to make the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.

5. **Enhanced test coverage** - Added a package structure test to ensure that all modules can be imported successfully.

## 🚀 Usage

### Building and Running

```bash
# Build the Docker image
./rebuild_fastfs.sh

# Run the server
./rebuild_fastfs.sh --run

# Run with custom mount path
./rebuild_fastfs.sh --run --mount /path/to/directory

# Run with GitHub authentication
./rebuild_fastfs.sh --run --github-token YOUR_TOKEN

# Enable debug logging
./rebuild_fastfs.sh --run --debug

# Run tests
./rebuild_fastfs.sh --test
```

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Configure Claude Desktop to use the FastFS-MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "-v", "C:\\Users\\username:/mnt/workspace:rw",
        "fastfs-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## 📝 Progress Memory

- Fixed package structure with properly indented `base.py` file
- Created unified build script `rebuild_fastfs.sh`
- Added comprehensive documentation with Mermaid diagrams
- Added package structure tests
